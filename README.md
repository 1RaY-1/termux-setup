# About
This is my Termux setup

# What this script does
This script does this things:
* Update, upgrade packages
* Give Termux a storage access permission
* Install some programs
* Create some bash aliases
* Configure vim
* Upgrade pip and install some modules
* Remove Termux welcome text if you want to, but for this you'll have to uncoment this command on *111th* line
* Install ToolX if you want to, but for this you'll have to uncoment those commands from *116th* line

# Note
I didn't test this on an android device yet. So maybe there some errors can be ocurred, but I don't think so.
